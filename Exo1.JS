/*Test 1: Any language (3/20)
Write a program that outputs sequentially the integers from 1 to 99 but on some conditions prints a string instead:
when the integer is a multiple of 3 print “Open” instead of the number,
when it is a multiple of 7 print “Source” instead of the number,
when it is a multiple of both 3 and 7 print “OpenSource” instead of the number.*/
